# cryengine 5.5 topdown game project

Welcome to my topdown game project. This project is mostly a basic foundation that any game could be build on. 

The game has no story, enemies are not moving yet but that's not that hard to implement because recursive action queue works well (handmade!).


Currently supported features [as far as I remember]:
- click-to-move with CE's built-in pathfinding (remember to place proper nav area in the level)
- physicalized items
- regenable attributes like health/mana
- inventory (with ugly UI)
- multiple camera 
- almost(!) walking AI

I wanted to make this in diablo style; unfortunately, it's not finished. 
I am planning a Oculus Rift VR game project for my CS engineering thesis. I will have to choose between CE 5(.6) or Unity.

All the commits have been squashed to one for publishing. Sorry for that
